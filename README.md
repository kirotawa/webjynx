#### Web Jynx
What is and what the heck I'll do with this?
A: In a quick and simply way what it does it help you to follow the patches a given sha commit represents.

But Why?
A: Well, I particulary need this or at least already needed and didn't have. Sometimes I just type a lot of git log and format-patch to see if that patch has a piece of code important to backport any feature I was working. Webjynx comes to make this easy, and that is the point.
